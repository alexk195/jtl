# JTL
## Java Template Language Extension
Java Template Language (JTL) is a “template processor”, which can generate arbitrary textual output based on a data and a template. The reason for such tool is to separate varying and fixed patterns about text and code generation into a definition (data) and a template. 
Usually JTL uses template files (stored with extension jtl) and data definition files (stored as def or json or csv files) to generate arbitrary textual document. Additional features make it well suitable for code generation as well.
